# 3D-Arduino-Safe
The code for an arduino based 3D printed safe. 

A 3D printed safe that incorporates many electrical components, including an
            ardiuno uno and nano, a servo motor, a LCD display, a keypad and a RFID card 
            and reader. The safe has a two step verification, which is a password that is 
            set by the user and an RFID card. Both steps need to be verified before the servo
            motor moves, meaning the safe unlocks.
